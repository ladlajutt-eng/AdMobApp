To put it more simply; AdMob allows you to earn money by adding ads to your mobile app.

AdMob is one of the most preferred revenue generating models in the Android world, bringing advertisers and developers together.
AdMob offers revenue based on the rate of clicks on ads, rather than charging based on the number of downloads of apps.
You can earn high earnings based on the popularity of your application, thanks to which users show ads according to the categories they are interested in.
